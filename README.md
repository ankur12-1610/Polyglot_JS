Hey hackers!
It’s time for you to implement what you’ve learned during the workshop. In this assignment you’ll use the basics of variable declaration, function declaration and implementation and DOM manipulation!

- Just fork this repository: 
- Clone it :
- Create a branch and switch to it:

And finally…CODE!

###Setting up the repo locally:
- ```yarn dev```
###Testing the code locally:
- ```yarn test```
or
- ```yarn test:ui``` (for the UI tests)
###Building the code:
- ```yarn build```
> Essential if you want to deploy your code to GitHub Pages.

We need you to deploy your repo to GitHub Pages. Follow this [blog post](https://www.codecademy.com/article/f1-u3-github-pages) for the same.

We’ve already set up a skeleton using HTML and CSS for you. Just follow the instructions given as comments and bring the skeleton to life!
