// Add here all the scenarios you can think of!

// The only condition being : add 3 playerCard description for 1 hackerCard Situation. We've already added a few as an example.

// P.S.: Keep in mind the Power of the number so the witty players don't end up losing :p

// How 'power' works : write a power for the hacker's card and while you write powers for the player's cards, keep in mind that the power of the correct counters should be greater than the hacker's card's power.
