// HELLO FELLOW CODERS! WE WELCOME YOU TO THE WORLD OF JAVASCRIPT 

//----- We've curated this assignment for someone staring out in exploring the beauty of JavaScript and would urge you to go through the resources shared with you before you start with this. ----- // 

//Go through the CSS file as well to get a hold of all the attributes we've added. You're free to add some of your own and maybe delete some of ours xD

//The point is, we want you to have fun and use all the concepts while doing this task. In case of any doubts, feel free to reach out to us!

// Your main work would be here, in main.js and would advice you to also pay a visit to the scenario.js


// Life of the player and the hacker.
alert('Hackers card game');
var playerLife = 5;
var hackerLife = 5;

// Message to be displayed when the game is over
var hackerWinnerMessage = "Hacks over the game";
var playerWinnerMessage = "You won the games";

          // ---------------Game code starts here ---------------//

// declare a few handy variables like we've done :p

var playerStartLife = parseInt(5);
var hackerStartLife = parseInt(5);

// we will declare the functions for you and you will complete those 
updateScores();

// you learnt DOM manipulation right? here's an example of the same. Go ahead and use manipulate the DOM!
document.querySelector(".game-board").classList.add("before-game");

var allCardElements = document.querySelectorAll(".card");

// Adds click handler to all player card elements so that your cards are actionable


// An example of a function that controls what would happen when a card is clicked

function cardClicked(cardEl) {

  if(cardSelected) { return; }
  cardSelected = true;

  cardEl.classList.add("played-card");

  document.querySelector(".game-board").classList.add("card-selected");

  // Yes JS is cool and this would allow you to wait 500ms before revealing the hacker power
  setTimeout(function(){
    revealHackerPower();
  },500)

  setTimeout(function(){
    revealPlayerPower();
  },800)
  
  setTimeout(function(){
    compareCards();
  }, 1400);
}

// Now write a function that shows the power level on the player card
function revealPlayerPower(){
  
  
}

// Write a function that shows the power level on the hacker card
function revealHackerPower(){

}
// Write a function to compare the cards. Here is where all your skills would come in handy! 
// P.S: We've added the 'disabled' attribute in the CSS file for the button and you should use it in case you want a certain element to just go away or 'vanish' at a certain  time. For eg: You'd definitely want the 'Next' button to go away after a player chooses a card right?

function compareCards(){

}

//Use conditional statements and complete the function that shows the winner message
function gameOver(winner) {
  
}


// Write a function that starts the game
startButton.addEventListener('click',startGame);
const gameboard=document.getElementById('game-board');
function startGame() {
    
  console.log('game intialised');
  startButton.classList.add('hide');
  gameboard.classList.remove('hide');
    
    
     alert('click on startgame to play');
     
   
}


// Now write a function that starts the game over from scratch
function restartGame(){

}

// We've also used a cool life bar that displays the life left. Write a function that updates the displayed life bar and life totals
// use innerHTML and a lot of other cool things to do this. 
function updateScores(){

  // Here these update life totals for each player
  document.querySelector(".player-stats .life-total").innerHTML = playerLife;

  // We've added the code to update the player lifebar
  var playerPercent = playerLife / playerStartLife * 100;
  if (playerPercent < 0) {
    playerPercent = 0;
  }
  document.querySelector(".player-stats .life-left").style.height =  playerPercent + "%";

  // Now you write the code to update the hacker lifebar

}



// Write a function that Plays one turn of the game
function playTurn() {

}

// Finally write the function that reveals the cards. Use 
function revealCards(){

}
